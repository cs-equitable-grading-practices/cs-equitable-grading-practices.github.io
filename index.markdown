# Join our Community of Practice ##


Our group is focused on developing a community of practice made up of faculty interested in engaging with equitable grading practices in computer science classrooms. [Our upcoming meeting at the 2024 SIGCSE TS]({% post_url 2023-11-03-SIGCSE-24-Announce %}) will the first in a series of face-to-face meetings of this community of practice, which will grow over time. For this first meeting, the focus will be on faculty who have already adopted and have been using equitable grading practices in their classrooms. Faculty in this cohort of the community of practice meeting will be focusing on the sharing of resources and best practices as well as needs as the community grows.
